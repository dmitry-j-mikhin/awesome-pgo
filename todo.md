# TODO

Here I collect random thoughts and ideas about further PGO investigation.

* Ask Android devs about collection PGO profiles from an emulator. Now it says "simpleperf E event_type.cpp:508] Unknown event_type 'cs-etm', try `simpleperf list` to list all possible event type names" so it doesn't work with an emulator. From my Pixel 8 I also cannot gather profiles due to the "adbd cannot be runned in the production builds" adb error
